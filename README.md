# Java Data Structures Projects

This project includes three fundamental Java data structure examples: Stack, ArrayList, and Tree. Each example provides an interactive command-line interface that allows users to perform various operations.

## Stack

### Project Overview

Stack is a classic Exercises.stack data structure example written in Java. It allows users to perform the following operations:

- Push elements onto the Exercises.stack
- Pop elements from the Exercises.stack
- View the current Exercises.stack content

### How to Use

1. Run the `InteractiveStack` class's `main` method.

2. Follow the prompts and input one of the following commands:
   - Enter an element to push onto the Exercises.stack.
   - Enter "remove" to pop an element from the Exercises.stack.
   - Enter "exit" to exit the program.

3. The program will display the current Exercises.stack content after each operation.

4. When exiting the program, it will display "Program has exited."

## ArrayList

### Project Overview

ArrayList is a dynamic array example written in Java. It allows users to perform the following operations:

- Add elements to the array
- Remove elements from the array
- View the current array content

### How to Use

1. Run the `InteractiveArrayList` class's `main` method.

2. Follow the prompts and input one of the following commands:
   - Enter an element to add to the array.
   - Enter "remove" to remove an element from the array.
   - Enter "exit" to exit the program.

3. The program will display the current array content after each operation.

4. When exiting the program, it will display "Program has exited."

## Tree

### Project Overview

Tree is a binary Exercises.tree example written in Java. It allows users to perform the following operations:

- Add values to the binary Exercises.tree
- Remove values from the binary Exercises.tree
- View the current binary Exercises.tree content

### How to Use

1. Run the `InteractiveBinaryTree` class's `main` method.

2. Follow the prompts and input one of the following commands:
   - Enter a value to add to the binary Exercises.tree.
   - Enter "delete" to delete a value from the binary Exercises.tree.
   - Enter "exit" to exit the program.

3. If choosing "delete," you will be prompted to enter the integer value to delete.

4. The program will display the current state of the binary Exercises.tree (in-order traversal result) after each operation.

5. When exiting the program, it will display "Program has exited."

## Project Details

- Each example provides basic data structure operations and a user-friendly interactive interface.

- The sample projects are written in Java and come with corresponding classes and methods to perform various operations.

- You can extend and modify these examples as needed to fit different purposes and requirements.
